                   It's been almost a year since Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico. There are still people without a safe roof over their heads and electricity in their houses. However, islanders will always find the beach to be the place where they can let go of all worries and enjoy quality time. 
                   <p>Beaches in Puerto Rico are a main attraction for foreigners and locals since they are warm all year round. Yet one cannot forget that the environment impacts of a category four hurricane does not disappear in a short period of time. On the island all the rivers went out of their channel and dragged debris and dead animals for months. This project intends to answer the question that locals and visitors have:
                   <b><i>Are the Puerto Rican beaches in a worst state after Maria?</i></b>

            <h3>Year comparison</h3>
          <p>As you can see in the following maps, data collected by the Water Quality Monitoring Networks of the Environmental Quality Board (JCA) demonstrates that the quality of beach water remains practically the same and for some areas it even improved after hurricane Maria.

          <font><em style="color:black"><u>Note</u>: The JCA performs bacteriological analyzes throughout the year, twice a month, to confirm the levels of fecal contamination - enterococcal bacteria - in the water. The limit of enterococci per 100 milliliters of seawater in Puerto Rico is 70. They call this amount 'Beach Action Value':
